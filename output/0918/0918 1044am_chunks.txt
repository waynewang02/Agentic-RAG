Evacuate surrounding areas. Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from 
entering. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Shut off all ignition sources.
No flares, smoking or flames in hazard area. Avoid breathing vapor or mist. Provide 
adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate. Put 
on appropriate personal protective equipment.
Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains 
and sewers. Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental 
pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air).
Large spill :Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and 
explosion-proof equipment. Dilute with water and mop up if water-soluble. Alternatively,
or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste 
disposal container. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.Small spill :Methods and materials for containment and cleaning upFor non-emergency

locked up. Eliminate all ignition sources. Separate from oxidizing materials. Keep 
container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use. Containers that have been 
opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage. Do not store in 
unlabeled containers. Use appropriate containment to avoid environmental 
contamination.:
:may be inadequate to eliminate fire and explosion hazards. Carefully review operations 
that may increase the risks such as tank and container filling, tank cleaning, sampling,
gauging, loading, filtering, mixing, agitation, etc. In addition to bonding and grounding,
efforts to mitigate the hazards may include, but are not limited to, ventilation, inerting 
and/or reduction of transfer velocities.
Always keep nozzle in contact with the container throughout the loading process. Do 
NOT fill any portable container in or on a vehicle.
Special precautions, such as reduced loading rates and increased monitoring, must be 
observed during "switch loading" operations (i.e., loading this material in tanks or 
shipping compartments that previously contained a dissimilar product).
Bulk Storage Conditions: Maintain all storage tanks in accordance with applicable 
regulations. Use necessary controls to monitor tank inventories. Inspect all storage 
tanks on a periodic basis. Test tanks and associated piping for tightness. Maintain the 
automatic leak detection devices to assure proper working condition.

Hand protection
Use a properly fitted, air-purifying or supplied-air respirator complying with an approved 
standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Respirator selection must be 
based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe 
working limits of the selected respirator.Chemical-resistant gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all 
times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary.
Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that 
the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be noted that the time 
to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different glove 
manufacturers.Safety glasses equipped with side shields are recommended as minimum protection in 
industrial settings. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless 
the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: Splash goggles. Safety 
eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment 
indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists, gases or dusts.
chemical splash goggles. If inhalation hazards exist, a full-face respirator may be 
required instead.Eye/face protection
Respiratory protection :::
Body protection Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being 
performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before 
handling this product.:Environmental exposure 
controls:Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure 
they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some 
cases, vapor controls, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will 
be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.Appropriate engineering 
controls:Use only with adequate ventilation. Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or 
other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any 
recommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas,
vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof 
ventilation equipment.
Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before 
eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.
Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.
Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety 
showers are close to the workstation location.Hygiene measures :Individual protection measures

Other skin protection :Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected 
based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a

Content: Section 13. Disposal considerations
The generation of waste should be avoided or minimized wherever possible. Disposal 
of this product, solutions and any by-products should at all times comply with the 
requirements of environmental protection and waste disposal legislation and any 
regional local authority requirements. Dispose of surplus and non-recyclable products 
via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Waste should not be disposed of untreated to 
the sewer unless fully compliant with the requirements of all authorities with jurisdiction.
Waste packaging should be recycled. This material and its container must be disposed 
of in a safe way. Care should be taken when handling emptied containers that have not 
been cleaned or rinsed out. Empty containers or liners may retain some product 
residues. Vapor from product residues may create a highly flammable or explosive 
atmosphere inside the container. Do not cut, weld or grind used containers unless they 
have been cleaned thoroughly internally. Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff 
and contact with soil, waterways, drains and sewers.: Disposal methods
