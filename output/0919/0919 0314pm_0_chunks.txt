Content: Section III.III. Hazards Identification.
Contact can cause slight irritation of skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Extremely dangerous in case of ingestion. For more
information, refer to Section 11.11.Potential Health
Effects
DO NOT induce vomiting because of danger of aspirating liquid into lungs. Seek medical attention.Eye Contact
Skin Contact
Inhalation
IngestionIMMEDIATELY flush eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, keeping eyelids open. Seek medical attention.
Remove contaminated clothing - launder before reuse. Wash gently and thoroughly the contaminated skin with running water
and non-abrasive soap. Seek medical attention.
Evacuate the victim to a safe area as soon as possible. If the victim is not breathing, perform artificial respiration. Allow the
victim to rest in a well ventilated area. Seek medical attention.Section IV.IV

Section VI.VI. Accidental Release Measures
Material Release
or SpillSmall spill or leak: Dilute with water and mop up or absorb with an inert DRY material and place in an appropriate waste
disposal container.
Large spill or leak: Absorb with an inert material and put the spilled material in an appropriate waste disposal. Dispose of in
accordance with regional regulations.
Storage Keep container dry. Keep container tightly closed. Keep in a cool, well-ventilated place.Avoid contamination with reactive substances. After handling, always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. HandlingSection VII.VII. Handling and Storage
Engineering Controls
Personal Protection - The selection of personal protective equipment varies, depending upon conditions of use.For normal application, special ventilation is not necessary. If user's operations generate vapours or mist, use ventilation to
keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air
removed by exhaust ventilation. Ensure that eyewash station and safety shower are close to work-station.
Wear appropriate footwear to prevent product from coming in contact with feet and skin.Section VIII.VIII

Eyes
Body
Respiratory
Hands
FeetWear appropriate chemically protective gloves. When handling hot product ensure gloves are heat resistant and insulated.Where concentrations in air may exceed the occupational exposure limits given in Section 2 (and those applicable to your
area) and where engineering, work practices or other means of exposure reduction are not adequate, NIOSH approved
respirators may be necessary to prevent overexposure by inhalation.Wear appropriate clothing to prevent skin contact. As a minimum long sleeves and trousers should be worn.Eye protection (i.e., safety glasses, safety goggles and/or face shield) should be determined based on conditions of use. If
product is used in an application where splashing may occur, the use of safety goggles and/or a face shield should be
considered.
